## Descripttion

The coding boot camp students WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT they can gauge their progress compared to their peers
GIVEN the users are taking a code quiz

WHEN the users click the start button
THEN a timer starts and the users are presented with a question

WHEN the users answer a question
THEN the users are presented with another question

WHEN the users answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock

WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over

WHEN the game is over
THEN the users can save their initials and their score
